# FreeTAKServer-Simulator-UI-Example

This is a simple Flask based web app that uses 
[FreeTAKServer-Simulator](https://github.com/lennisthemenace/FreeTAKServer-Simulator)
to play a gpx file to TAK

In order to run this you will need to copy in the 
[FreeTAKServer-Simulator](https://github.com/lennisthemenace/FreeTAKServer-Simulator) 
module and
[takpak](https://github.com/pinztrek/takpak) module into the root folder of the app 
and run:
```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
before running the web app for the first time.
